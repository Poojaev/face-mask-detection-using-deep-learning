# Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning

## Introduction
The **Face Mask Detection System** is a deep learning-based application that identifies whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled images of masked and unmasked faces to ensure accurate detection in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time face mask detection** using OpenCV and deep learning.
- **CNN-based model** trained on a large dataset of face images.
- **Supports multiple camera feeds** for real-time monitoring.
- **High accuracy** in detecting masks with different orientations and lighting conditions.
- **Alerts and notifications** for mask policy violations.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Dataset**: Publicly available face mask datasets
- **Hardware**: Compatible with CPU/GPU for performance optimization

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing images categorized into:
- **With Mask**: Faces wearing masks correctly.
- **Without Mask**: Faces without masks.
- **Incorrect Mask**: Faces wearing masks incorrectly.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
- Install Python 3.7 or later.
- Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```
- Download or collect a dataset for training.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd face-mask-detection
   ```
3. Train the model (optional, if not using a pre-trained model):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Run the real-time detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect_mask.py
   ```
5. The camera will activate, and real-time mask detection will begin.

## Usage
- **Train Model**: Use `train.py` to train a custom model.
- **Real-time Detection**: Run `detect_mask.py` for real-time monitoring.
- **Analyze Results**: Save and evaluate detection outputs.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Integrate with IoT for automated access control.
- Deploy as a web or mobile application.
